		<p>Talk about products, philosophy, etc. here, perhaps in a 2-column format. It also seems like the design may need to be a little cleaner / more professional looking: buttons instead of text on link bar, boxes to hold text, etc. to make the eye go across the page better. I added extra margins around the edge to help with this.</p>

What is a bail bond?<br><br>

The bail bond system gives someone who has been charged with a crime the opportunity to get out of jail and remain free until trial. In Minnesota, a judge will set a bail amount based on the severity of the crime committed, the offender&rsquo;s previous criminal history and how likely the offender is to flee. Paying the bail amount allows the defendant to be released from jail with the understanding that he or she will return to court for trial.<br>

Defendants can pay the entire bail amount to the court with that money going toward any fees and fines that might be awarded at a later date or hire a bail bond company to assist with the payment/process. Bail Bond Agents collect a non-refundable fee and become liable to the court for the full amount of bail if the defendant fails to appear for their court date(s). A co-signer (friend or family member of the defendant) is often required, and collateral may also be necessary to cover the full cost of the bail. The need for collateral is determined by the financial capabilities of the co-signer, risk of the bond, and credit/financial/criminal history. If needed, the collateral acts as security to ensure payment for any losses that the bail agent may encounter if the defendant does not return for trial. If all goes as it should, the collateral is returned when the case has gone through the full court process and the defendant is either charged or the case is discharged.<br>

A bail bond agent will need to decide if the defendant is &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; and unlikely to return for trial. If so, the agent may refuse to post bail. A &ldquo;low risk&rdquo; defendant is one that has a record of steady employment, has never missed a court date in the past, and has resided in the community for a good length of time.<br>

If a defendant out on bond does not return for trial, the court will go after the bail bond company instead of the individual. The bail bond agent is authorized to arrest the defendant for the purposes of bringing him or her to court, and may go after the co-signer for additional compensation for their time and for any fees the courts may impose.<br>
